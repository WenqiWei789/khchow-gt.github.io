                    <h4>SRA: Smart Recovery Advisor for Cyber Attacks</h4>
                    <p>Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is becoming instrumental in recovering applications from crypto-ransomware attacks. It enables fine-grained recovery through journaling, allowing the applications (its volumes) to recover to any previous state. While zero data loss can be achieved during recovery with CDP, the timestamp of the desired restore point, i.e., the one just prior to the attack, needs to be provided to reconstruct the volume. Such information is often unavailable in practice, and system administrators can only adopt a trial-and-error strategy to narrow down the time range of desired restore points by making multiple time-consuming recovery attempts. The recovery systems offer little guidance in pointing to the restore points containing a valid application state and reducing data loss. To address this problem, we equip the CDP-based recovery with machine intelligence and present Smart Recovery Advisor (SRA) in our paper at <a target="_blank" href="media/SIGMOD21_SRA.pdf">SIGMOD 2021</a>, which offers interpretable, data-driven, and feedback-aware restore point recommendations that reduce the number of recovery attempts while minimizing data loss.</p>

                    <p>SRA intercepts the block-level read/write requests between the application and its block storage device. The data-driven component extracts salient features from the block-level I/O request stream. Upon initiating a recovery session on the user interface shown below, SRA models normal I/O behavior of the workload and compiles the suspicious events in a ranked list of RPs, where each RP is associated with a recommendation summary to assist administrators in selecting the RP for the next recovery attempt. SRA also collects the user feedback for analysis to refine the strategy of generating the next batch of RP recommendations with recovery semantic inference and session-tailored optimization.</p>

                    <h4>Deep Learning at the Edge: Real-time Object Detection with AI Accelerators</h4>
                    <p>
                        With advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), there has been a proliferation of revolutionizing products. Yet, the popularization of such DNN-powered applications is hindered because their success is built on intensive computations and powerful GPUs. This project aims at accelerating deep neural networks on edge devices using Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS). We show that NCS is capable of speeding up the inference time of complicated neural networks, which can be efficient enough to run locally on edge devices. Such acceleration paves the way to develop ensemble learning on the edge for performance improvement. In our <a target="_blank" href="https://git-disl.github.io/DLEdge/">open-source project</a>, we accelerate the well-known object detection algorithm, named <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02767">YOLOv3</a>, and develop a web-based visualization platform to support (ensemble) object detection. Photos and videos from local files or webcam are supported. Frame per second (FPS) is displayed to indicate the speed-up made by one or more NCS devices running in parallel.
